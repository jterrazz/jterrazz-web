# Jterrazz Web

> A personal portfolio website showcasing my development projects, photography, and articles. Discover my work in web development, explore my collection of photographs, and read my latest articles all in one place.

## Features

-   **Projects**: Showcase of my development projects with links to the live site and GitHub repository.
-   **Photography**: Collection of my photographs with a lightbox gallery for viewing.
-   **Articles**: Blog posts on web development, photography, and other topics.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Get Started üçã

### Quick Start with Docker

Getting started with our API is simple! We use **docker** to manage the application and its dependencies. If you haven't installed Docker yet, you can follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to set it up.

To launch the project, use the following command:

```sh
# Start the project
make start
```

With this quick setup, you'll be ready to explore the power of our Open Market API and build seamless experiences for customers. Happy coding!
To help you **develop**, we provide a few scripts to run the project with hot reload, and run tests.

```sh
# Develop the project with hot reload
make start-dev

# Run tests
make test
```

### Quick start with Node.js

If you want to run the project locally, you will need to install the following dependencies:

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Since this project requires external services (database, etc), you will need to run them manually.

```sh
make start-infra
```

#### Start the project

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the project
npm run start

# Develop the project with hot reload
npm run start:dev
```

#### Run tests

```sh
npm run test
```

## Code quality üèó

### Tests

The **`jest` framework** is used to run both **integration** (`/tests/e2e/*.test.ts`) and **unit** tests (`__tests__/*.test.ts`).
The tests are run on **Github Actions** on each push.

### Linting

The **`eslint` framework** is used to lint the code. The rules are defined in the `.eslintrc` file.
