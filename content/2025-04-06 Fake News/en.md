# Let's playfully question everything

Have you ever scrolled past a headline and felt it was engineered for a click? Or shared an article on title alone, swept up in the moment? We've all been there. In a world saturated with information, how do we become more mindful readers—and have a little fun doing it?

That's the question that sparked the idea for my first mobile app. The goal is simple and optimistic: to encourage people to playfully question the news they see every day.

## Why this app?

The idea sparked not from a grand revelation, but from a simple observation. I noticed how often headlines are crafted to provoke a reaction rather than to inform. Sensationalism and bias can easily eclipse objectivity, pulling us into echo chambers. A news source considered "neutral" in one country might be viewed as anything but elsewhere, simply because of cultural and political context.

I saw a chance to do more than just preach about critical thinking. I wanted to turn it into a game.

The question that truly lit a fire under me was this: could I build something genuinely enjoyable that also arms people with a healthy, constructive curiosity about the media?

At first, the concept felt monumental. How could I possibly generate an endless stream of engaging content, detect subtle nuances, and make the whole thing scalable? Then, as I began exploring what AI could do, the pieces clicked into place.

## How AI makes it possible

To put it simply, AI is the engine that powers the app. It's what makes the entire project feasible. It gives me abilities that would have been pure science fiction just a few years ago, like generating content automatically, identifying subtle perspectives, and presenting news from multiple angles. Its capacity to process massive amounts of data with incredible speed and accuracy is what breathes life into this vision.

AI has also completely reshaped my development process. I'll share a deeper dive into my AI-driven workflow in a future article, but here are the highlights:

- **Building at speed:** I spend less time wrestling with repetitive code and more time guiding the AI. This lets me focus on the core vision and perfect the details. Modern AI tools can suggest, complete, and even write entire blocks of code, making development a faster, more creative partnership.
- **Infinite content:** AI is my tireless creative partner. It helps generate endless, high-quality variations, ensuring the app always feels fresh and exciting. This level of hyper-personalization is becoming the new standard—just think of how Netflix and Spotify always have something new just for you.
- **Seeing all sides:** Advanced AI models can analyze articles from different viewpoints and highlight potential perspectives. This is essential for making the app a tool for discovery, not just a game.
- **Smart summaries:** The AI can distill complex stories in near real-time, giving users the key takeaways without sacrificing crucial context.

And the most exciting part? Every new AI model release makes the app smarter and more insightful. I feel like I'm riding a technological wave that's constantly lifting us higher.

## The exciting challenges ahead

Building an AI-powered app to reshape media habits is a journey, not a destination. Here are the challenges I'm excited to tackle next:

- **The pursuit of truthfulness:** This is the most important quest. AI is a powerful tool, but it's always learning. One of the most promising paths forward is to involve the community—allowing users to flag content, vote on the credibility of headlines, and co-create a more reliable experience.
- **Making it fun:** An app should be a joy to use. I'm constantly refining the interface, polishing the visuals, and adding delightful touches like animations and haptic feedback. The goal is to make media literacy feel less like a chore and more like a captivating game.

The app is built with **React Native and Expo**, which ensures it runs as a smooth, native app on both iOS and Android—a solid foundation for all the fun on top.

## My journey: from zero to the App Store

Building my first mobile app from scratch has been an incredible education:

- **The App Store adventure:** Writing a compelling app description, engaging with user feedback, and diving deep into UI/UX—it was all a new world for me. It's both humbling and thrilling to see something you built come to life in the hands of others.
- **Minimalism as a guiding principle:** For me, minimalism is about clarity and focus. I believe in keeping things simple. Every project I start is designed to be self-sufficient, easy to maintain, and adaptable. I use a hexagonal architecture, for example, to keep the app's core stable and independent, no matter how the world around it changes. Minimalism also means smart delegation. Soon, I plan to explore using AI agents for tasks like marketing to streamline my workflow even further.
- **The journey continues:** Now that the app is launched, a new adventure begins: optimizing AI costs, sharing the app with the world, and continuously shipping improvements. Honestly, that's where the real excitement lies.

## AI as a 'frontend for content'

Here's a concept I can't stop thinking about: AI isn't just a tool; it's creating an entirely new interface for information itself. The raw data—the news—has always been there, but we had to do the heavy lifting of finding it and connecting the dots ourselves.

Now, AI lets us pre-process and package that information to perfectly suit a user's needs. From a single dataset, AI can generate infinite personalized interfaces. It reminds me of that *Black Mirror* episode where you become the main character in a show. The underlying story is the same, but you are placed at the center of the experience. AI does something similar. It takes a single source of information and creates countless personal entry points, making the same story feel uniquely yours every single time.

## Join the movement

The app is more than an app—it's an invitation to build a smarter, more curious community together. If you enjoy a good mental workout and love the idea of playing with information, I'd be thrilled for you to give it a try.

Let's build a world where curiosity becomes second nature—one headline at a time.
