# Let's playfully question everything

We live in a world where headlines are engineered to trigger reactions rather than encourage thought. Sensationalism sells, and nuance often gets lost in the noise. This dynamic trains us to be reactive, sharing articles based on titles alone without engaging with the content.

This project, **Fake News**, was born from a desire to flip that script. Instead of building another news aggregator, the goal was to build a game—one that uses the addictive mechanics of mobile apps to teach media literacy and critical thinking.

## Gamifying the Truth

The core concept is simple: can we make spotting bias fun?

A news story is rarely black and white. The same event can be framed as a "liberation" or an "invasion" depending on the source. The app challenges players to identify these subtle shifts in perspective, rewarding them for spotting bias and understanding nuance. It turns the chore of "fact-checking" into a dopamine-driven gameplay loop.

## AI as the Engine

This project relies heavily on Artificial Intelligence, not just as a feature, but as the core infrastructure that makes it scalable.

AI acts as an automated editorial room, enabling the platform to:
- **Generate infinite scenarios:** Creating unique quiz content based on real-time trends ensures the game never feels stale.
- **Analyze multiple perspectives:** The system scans articles from various viewpoints to highlight how different outlets spin the same facts.
- **Synthesize clarity:** It distills complex geopolitical stories into bite-sized, verifiable facts.

This architecture allows a small project to function with the content volume of a much larger organization.

## The "Truth" Architecture

Building the technology is one thing; establishing "truth" is another. AI models can hallucinate or inherit biases.

To address this, the platform architecture is designed to integrate a community-driven layer where users can flag inconsistencies and vote on credibility. The long-term vision is a "Wikipedia model" for news validation—a collective effort to maintain accuracy rather than a black box decision.

Under the hood, the app is built with **React Native and Expo**, ensuring a smooth experience across iOS and Android. It utilizes **Hexagonal Architecture** to keep the core game logic—scoring, rules, and truth validation—completely isolated from external services. This separation allows for swapping AI providers or changing data sources without rewriting the application, keeping the system robust and adaptable.

## A New Interface for Information

This project explores a larger shift in how we consume the web. AI is becoming a new interface for information.

Instead of digging through tabs and cross-referencing sources manually, we can now use AI to pre-process and package information in the format that best suits the user. It represents a move towards personalized learning, where the news adapts to the reader's curiosity level.

## Join the Experiment

The app is an invitation to build a smarter, more curious community. It’s a digital gym for critical thinking.
