# Cursor: My Practical Guide to AI-Powered Development

**The way we build software is going through a massive shift. AI isn't a gimmick anymore; it's a tool I can't code without. I've been living in the world of AI-assisted development for a while, and one tool has completely changed how I work: Cursor. It's more than an editor. It feels like the next step in development.**

For years, the debate was WebStorm vs. VS Code‚Äîhow to best optimize our personal setup. Cursor changes the game entirely. Imagine a team of 100 world-class developers, funded by a nine-figure budget, setting up the perfect coding environment for you. An environment designed so an AI can understand your project, your goals, and your intent, instantly. That's the power Cursor gives you right out of the box.

Most AI coding tools stumble on the same hard problems:
* **Context:** How do you feed the AI the right info about your project?
* **Timing:** When do you give it that info?
* **Interface:** How do you interact with its suggestions without breaking your flow?
* **Power:** Are you using the latest, smartest models?
* **Efficiency:** How do you manage usage and costs without thinking about it?

Cursor nails these problems. It wraps everything into one smart, intuitive experience. It's not about typing code faster. **It's about changing your job from a "code typist" to a "code architect."** **You focus on the vision and the quality, while the AI does the heavy lifting.** The result for me? I'm more productive, the code is cleaner, naming is better, and my test coverage is higher‚Äîall with what feels like less effort.

It's like having a senior dev team inside your editor. A team that still needs clear direction, especially for big or brand-new ideas, but one that gets you there faster. I find myself writing less code by hand and spending more time in a simple loop: **"instruct -> review."**

## Use Cases: How My Day-to-Day Changed

Cursor's real magic is how seamlessly it gets you, the AI, and your code to work together. The UX is so fluid that it feels like a natural extension of your thoughts.

### 1. It Just *Knows* Your Codebase

![](assets/indexing.jpg)

This is what blew my mind right away. Forget copy-pasting code into a separate chat window.
* **Zero Setup:** Just open a project, and Cursor starts learning.
* **Smart Indexing:** It maps out your entire codebase, understanding how everything connects.
* **Autonomous Context:** It finds what it needs across files, reads any file it has to, and can even run commands like linters or tests to figure things out on its own. You can literally tell it, "Make `@montest.test.ts` pass," and watch it run the test, see it fail, find the right imports, and draft a fix.

### 2. "Tab Tab Tab" on Steroids

Think GitHub Copilot, but with a turbocharger.
* **Predictive Power:** It doesn't just complete the line you're on; it often anticipates the entire block of code you're thinking of writing.

*Multi-line completions*

* **Cursor Prediction:** It even predicts where you'll want to move your cursor next. Just hit tab, and you're there.
* **One-Click Magic:** Simple things become effortless. Click on a messy JSON, and it's instantly beautified. It will also offer to rephrase an awkward comment or fix a small mistake with a single click.

*Edits based on a single click (this is a simple example, but it handles complex updates beautifully)*

### 3. The Built-In Chat: Your AI Coding Partner

![](assets/chat.jpg)
*Ask anything*

The chat isn't just a Q&A bot; it's a collaborator that knows your project inside and out.
* **Codebase-Aware Chat:** Its suggestions are spot-on because it understands the context of your work.
* **Easy Referencing with `@`:** This is huge. Type `@filename` or `@symbol` to point the AI exactly where it needs to look. No more ambiguity.

![](assets/include.jpg)
*Reference files manually with @*

* **Targeted Edits:** The "Apply" button is smart. It inserts or changes code in the right place, even if it's across multiple files or at opposite ends of the same file.

![](assets/apply.jpg)
*Apply code automatically*

* **Extra Powers:** You can feed it images (like a UI mockup) to generate code, or give it a link to a GitHub issue or online docs, and it will use that as context. It even has built-in knowledge for popular frameworks. Typing `@NextJs` brings the official Next.js docs right into your chat.

*A ton of different @context sources to power your prompts*

### 4. Editing with Plain English (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K)

This feature is a game-changer for refactoring and quick edits.
* **Natural Language Commands:** Hit `Cmd+K`, and tell it what you want. "Refactor this into an async function." "Add JSDoc comments." "Explain this regex to me."
* **Beautiful Diffs:** Cursor shows you the proposed changes with a clean, clear visual diff. You can review, accept, or ask for a revision in seconds.
* **Terminal Genius:** `Cmd+K` in the terminal lets you write shell commands with plain English. "Find all files larger than 1MB and zip them." Done.

*Inline prompts, inline code diffs*

### 5. Agent Mode: Letting the AI Off the Leash

For bigger tasks, Agent Mode gives the AI the freedom to think and act on its own.
* **Autonomous Problem-Solving:** The agent breaks down your request into a plan, explores the codebase, creates new files, runs commands, and even self-corrects if it hits an error.
* **Auto-Fixing Linter Errors:** It can connect to your project's linter and automatically fix warnings and errors based on your rules.
* **It automatically applies the changes and presents you with a "PR-style" diff right inside your IDE. It's incredible. üòç**

*This is my go-to mode for 99% of my work now.

*It searched the web, added the new brands, and created the new test file, all from one prompt.*

## My Experience: Tips, Tricks, and a New Mindset

After using Cursor daily for over a year, I've learned a few things that have completely changed my approach to development.

### Making the AI *Your* Co-Pilot

* **Cursor Rules:** This is where you can train Cursor to follow your project's specific coding style. I use it to enforce a "Given-When-Then" pattern for all my test descriptions. It's just a simple file in the `.cursor/rules` directory.
		* *Example:* [You can see my project-specific rules here](https://github.com/jterrazz/fake-news-api/blob/main/.cursor/rules).

* **Know Your Models:** It helps to understand the "personality" of different AI models. Cursor is smart about routing your requests, but thinking about it helps you write better prompts. Here's a simple way I see it:
		* **The Planner:** A powerful model like `GPT-4` or `Claude 3 Opus` is great for high-level strategy or breaking down a complex task.
		* **The Coder:** A model fine-tuned for code, like a specialized `Gemini Pro` or `Claude 3.5`, is best for generating the actual code.
		* **The Debugger:** A mix of models can work here‚Äîstrong ones for generating test cases and faster ones for quick, iterative fixes.
* **Leverage MCPs (Model-Capable Plugins):** Think of these as specialized toolkits for external services like AWS or Stripe. They allow the AI to generate code using real, up-to-the-minute API documentation.

### Superhuman Refactors & Fixes

* **Reapply a Commit:** This is a mind-bendingly powerful trick. "Reapply the changes from commit `[hash]` to this file, but adapt them for the new structure."
* **"Make the Tests Green":** I literally tell Cursor to run my test suite and fix whatever fails until everything passes. It's an absolute superpower for TDD or integrating a new feature.

## The Mental Shift: You're the Director Now

The biggest change isn't speed; it's your mindset.
* **Embrace Your Role as Director:** Your job is to guide the AI. Give it clear instructions and ensure the final product matches your vision. The AI becomes an extension of your intent‚Äîlike a brilliant colleague you've worked with for years.
* **Delegate Everything You Can:** The more you offload to the AI, the more mental energy you have for the big picture: architecture, user experience, and solving the *right* problems.
* **The "Vibe Coding" Trap:** The biggest danger is trusting the machine blindly or coding without a clear goal. That leads to messy code and wasted time. **You still have to be the driver.** You have to know where you're going and give specific directions, as if you were just coding at light speed yourself.
* **High-Quality by Default:** Here's the paradox: AI assistance actually pushes you to write *better* code. Since you're reviewing more than typing, you naturally pay more attention to naming, structure, and tests. **You start trusting the tests more than the code itself.**

### Intent-Driven Development (IDD)

This all leads to a workflow I call **Intent-Driven Development (IDD)**. Just as TDD uses tests to drive code design, IDD uses clear, high-level intent to drive development.
* **Focus on Value:** Drawing from first-principles thinking, IDD forces you to ask, "What value does this feature bring?" Your job is to translate that value into clear intent for the AI.
* **High-Level "Intent Tests":** Sometimes I'll write a high-level test that captures a core user story (e.g., `user_can_checkout_successfully.intent.test.ts`). Then, my goal is simple: instruct the AI to make that test pass.

This keeps every line of code tied to a clear, valuable outcome.

## Getting Started with Cursor

Ready to jump in?
1. **Go Pro:** The free tier is great, but the Pro plan (around $20/month) gives you access to the most powerful models like GPT-4 and Claude 3 Opus. This is where the magic really happens.
2. **Personalize It:** Don't stick with the defaults. Spend 10 minutes in the settings. Set up your keybindings and choose your preferred models. (Here are my global Cursor settings for inspiration: [https://github.com/jterrazz/jterrazz-configuration/tree/main/configurations/cursor](https://github.com/jterrazz/jterrazz-configuration/tree/main/configurations/cursor)).
3. **Play with Everything:** Don't just live in the chat. Use `Cmd+K` edits. Try Agent Mode. Learn how to feed it context with `@`.

## You Are the Guiding Hand

The AI can handle the "how," but the "what" and "why" are still your job. "Vibe coding" won't build a secure, scalable, or maintainable product. The AI doesn't know your business, your users, or your long-term vision. Not yet, anyway.

You are the crucial **mediator** between a real-world need and the AI's incredible ability to execute. Your judgment, taste, and vision are more valuable than ever. Think of the AI as the world's most talented consultant. It's your job to apply its expertise to *your* project.

The default Cursor experience is amazing. But it becomes a superpower when you tailor it to your needs and focus on what truly matters. For me, that's building great things, faster, with a focus on exploration, search, commits, reviews, and rock-solid testing.

Cursor isn't just another tool. It's a partner. And when you guide it well, it can elevate your work to a whole new level.
