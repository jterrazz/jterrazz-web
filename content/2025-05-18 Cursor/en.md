# Cursor: AI-powered development

You need to refactor your authentication system to support OAuth providers. The task spans multiple files: the auth service, route handlers, database migrations, configuration management, and tests. You know the architecture, but the mechanical work—updating each file consistently, handling edge cases, ensuring tests cover the changes—will take hours.

Traditional approach: Open each file, make changes, reference other files to ensure consistency, run tests, debug failures, repeat. Three to four hours of focused work.

With Cursor: Write a high-level test describing the new OAuth flow. Tell the AI: "Make this test pass. Follow our existing auth patterns." Watch it generate the migration, update the service, modify routes, and write additional test cases. Review the changes, request adjustments where needed. Merge. Forty-five minutes, most of it spent reviewing rather than typing.

That difference is what makes Cursor worth understanding. It's not autocomplete on steroids—it's an editor built around AI's ability to understand your entire codebase and execute complex, multi-file changes while you focus on architecture and quality.

This guide covers what Cursor actually does, how the features translate to real workflows, and where it falls short.

## The core differentiator: codebase understanding

![](assets/indexing.jpg)

What separates Cursor from basic AI autocomplete tools is how it understands your entire project. When you open a codebase, Cursor indexes it automatically—mapping file relationships, tracking imports, understanding your architectural patterns. This isn't clever search; it builds a semantic model of how your code fits together.

The practical impact: You can reference any file, any function, any concept in your project without copy-pasting context. The AI already knows how your auth system works, what your database schema looks like, which testing patterns you follow. Requests like "refactor the user service to match how we handle organization entities" work because the AI understands both components and how they relate.

This contextual awareness extends beyond static code. Cursor can run your tests, analyze the failures, and propose fixes that account for your specific setup. It can invoke your linter, understand the rules you've configured, and apply fixes that match your code style.

## Features mapped to workflows

### Writing new code: intelligent completion

*Single-line completion*

*Multi-line completion*

The autocomplete goes beyond next-token prediction. Hit tab, and Cursor often generates the entire function body, test case, or configuration block you're about to write. It predicts based on your patterns: if you consistently use async/await, it generates async code; if you favor functional composition, it suggests that style.

Cursor prediction: After accepting a completion, tab again often moves your cursor to the logical next edit point—the next parameter, the next test case, the next similar block that needs updating.

One-click suggestions: Small quality improvements appear inline. A verbose comment gets a concise rephrase suggestion. An inconsistent variable name gets a better option. These aren't intrusive—they appear when helpful and disappear if ignored.

### Modifying existing code: Cmd+K inline edits

![](assets/inline-diff.jpg)

Hit `Cmd+K` (or `Ctrl+K`) on any selection and describe the change in natural language:
- "Refactor this to use async/await instead of promises"
- "Add JSDoc comments with type annotations"
- "Extract this logic into a separate helper function"

Cursor generates a diff showing the proposed changes. Accept, reject, or refine with a follow-up instruction. This works across multiple selections simultaneously—you can modify ten similar functions at once with one instruction.

Terminal mode: `Cmd+K` in the terminal translates English to shell commands. "Find all TypeScript files modified in the last week" becomes the appropriate `find` incantation. Useful for commands you can't recall the exact syntax for.

### Understanding code: chat with context

![](assets/chat.jpg)

The chat panel operates with full codebase context. You can ask architectural questions ("How does our caching layer work?"), debugging questions ("Why would this function throw a timeout error?"), or implementation questions ("What's the right way to add a new API endpoint given our existing patterns?").

The `@` reference system makes this precise:

![](assets/include.jpg)

- `@filename.ts` includes a specific file
- `@symbolName` references a function or class
- `@foldername` includes an entire directory
- `@docs` includes official documentation for frameworks
- `@web` performs a web search for current information
- `@codebase` searches your entire project

The Apply button inserts AI-generated code directly into your files, handling imports and positioning automatically:

This works across multiple files. Request "Add input validation to all API routes" and it can apply changes to dozens of files, maintaining consistency across all of them.

### Autonomous work: agent mode

![](assets/agent.jpg)

Agent mode handles multi-step tasks that require exploration, iteration, and error recovery. Instead of directing each action, you describe the objective and constraints.

Example: "Add support for CSV export to the analytics dashboard. Follow our existing export patterns for PDF."

The agent:
1. Explores existing export implementations to understand patterns
2. Creates the necessary backend endpoint and service logic
3. Updates the frontend to add the CSV export option
4. Generates tests covering the new functionality
5. Runs tests, identifies failures, and fixes them
6. Presents a complete diff of all changes

The process is visible—you see the agent's reasoning, which files it's examining, what commands it's running. You can interrupt, provide feedback, or let it continue. Once complete, you review the full diff like a pull request before accepting.

Agent mode excels at well-defined tasks with clear success criteria: implementing features that follow established patterns, fixing bugs with comprehensive tests, refactoring code to match new conventions. It struggles with novel architectures or ambiguous requirements where human judgment is essential.

## Practical configuration

### Cursor Rules

![](assets/rules.jpg)

Cursor respects project-specific rules defined in `.cursor/rules`. These enforce your team's conventions without repeating them in every prompt. Example rules:
- Test descriptions follow Given-When-Then format
- API responses use camelCase, not snake_case
- All public functions require JSDoc comments
- Prefer functional composition over class inheritance

[Example rules file](https://github.com/jterrazz/fake-news-api/blob/main/.cursor/rules)

### Model selection

Cursor routes requests to different models based on task complexity, but understanding model characteristics helps you write better prompts:

- **Planning:** Use powerful reasoning models (GPT-4, Claude Opus) for architectural decisions and complex refactors
- **Code generation:** Use specialized coding models (Claude Sonnet, Gemini Pro) for implementation
- **Quick fixes:** Use faster models for simple transformations and small edits

The Pro tier (around $20/month) provides access to frontier models. The free tier works but limits you to less capable models that produce noticeably weaker code.

### Useful patterns

**Reapply commits:** "Reapply the changes from commit [hash] to this file, but adapt them for the new structure." Useful when the same pattern needs to apply to refactored code.

**Test-driven fixes:** "Run the test suite and fix all failures." Agent mode iteratively runs tests, analyzes failures, implements fixes, and repeats until tests pass. This works remarkably well for integration tests with clear failure messages.

**Batch operations:** Select multiple similar functions and use Cmd+K with one instruction. "Add error handling to all these API calls" applies consistent changes across all selections.

## What doesn't work well

**Novel architectures:** When you're designing something genuinely new—a custom caching strategy, a novel data structure, an architectural pattern your codebase hasn't seen—Cursor struggles. It excels at following established patterns but can't innovate architectural approaches.

**Ambiguous requirements:** "Make this faster" or "improve the UX" produces generic, often misguided changes. AI needs concrete success criteria. "Reduce response time below 200ms by implementing request caching" works; vague improvement requests don't.

**Complex debugging:** When a bug requires deep domain knowledge or understanding subtle interactions across multiple systems, Cursor often proposes surface-level fixes that don't address the root cause. It's excellent at fixing clear test failures but weak at reasoning about why a system behaves unexpectedly.

**Cost without awareness:** Agent mode can rack up substantial API costs on complex tasks, especially if it gets stuck in loops. Monitor usage, set budget limits, and interrupt agents that aren't making progress.

**Context limitations:** Despite indexing, very large codebases (100k+ lines) can exceed context windows. The AI might miss relevant patterns in distant parts of the codebase, leading to inconsistent implementations.

**Vibe coding trap:** The ease of generation encourages accepting code without understanding it. This accumulates technical debt—code that works but nobody comprehends. You must review thoroughly. The AI is fast, not infallible.

## Intent-driven development

The workflow Cursor enables: write high-level tests describing desired outcomes, then direct the AI to make them pass. This is test-driven development elevated—instead of writing unit tests and implementations yourself, you write integration tests that capture user value and delegate the implementation details.

Example: Create `user_can_purchase_with_saved_card.intent.test.ts` describing the complete checkout flow with a saved payment method. Tell agent mode: "Make this test pass. Follow our existing payment processing patterns."

The AI implements the necessary service logic, updates the API, handles edge cases, and writes supporting tests. You review to ensure it matches your architecture and handles security correctly.

This keeps development focused on outcomes rather than implementation mechanics. Every feature starts with a clear statement of value that must be delivered.

## Adoption strategy

**Start with the Pro tier.** The free tier limits model access enough that you won't experience the tool's real capabilities. At $20/month, Pro is cheaper than the productivity gain from a single avoided debugging session.

**Configure deliberately.** Spend 30 minutes customizing keybindings, setting preferred models, and defining project rules. [Example configuration](https://github.com/jterrazz/jterrazz-configuration/tree/main/configurations/cursor) for reference.

**Learn the interaction modes progressively:**
1. Week 1: Use just autocomplete. Get comfortable with tab-based flow.
2. Week 2: Add Cmd+K for inline edits. Practice describing changes precisely.
3. Week 3: Use chat with `@` references for multi-file changes.
4. Week 4: Try agent mode on small, well-defined features.

**Establish review discipline early.** The ease of generation makes it tempting to accept code without understanding it. Every AI-generated change requires the same review rigor as code from a junior developer: Does it actually solve the problem? Does it handle edge cases? Is it maintainable?

**Monitor costs.** Agent mode can consume significant API credits on complex tasks. Set budget alerts and interrupt agents that aren't making progress.

## The role shift

Cursor changes what you spend time on. Less typing implementation details, more defining architecture and reviewing quality. Less debugging syntax errors, more reasoning about system behavior. Less mechanical refactoring, more strategic design decisions.

This isn't about coding faster—it's about operating at a higher level of abstraction. The mechanical work that consumed 60% of development time compresses to 20%, freeing attention for the problems that actually need human judgment: architecture, security, user experience, strategic technical decisions.

The AI handles the "how" exceptionally well. The "what" and "why" remain your responsibility. A tool that generates flawless code for the wrong feature is worse than useless—it's expensive misdirection.

Your value as a developer increasingly comes from architectural vision, domain expertise, and quality judgment. Cursor amplifies those skills by removing the mechanical barriers between intention and implementation. Use it to build better systems, not just to build faster.
