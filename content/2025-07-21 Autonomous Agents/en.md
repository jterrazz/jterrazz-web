# Using AI: Delegating the workflow

Imagine giving an AI a high-level goal—"Fix this bug" or "Build this feature"—and having it return a complete, tested pull request. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality of the **autonomous agent**.

At this stage, an AI graduates from a tool you direct to a delegate you supervise. You don't give it a line-by-line to-do list; you give it a high-level objective, access to the tools it needs, and then get out of its way. It figures out the plan, does the work, and comes back with a finished product ready for your final sign-off.

This is where your role transforms completely. You stop being a hands-on director and become a strategic supervisor. You stop building things brick by brick and start orchestrating the construction of entire buildings.

Let's explore how this actually works.

## **The Mindset: from supervisor to architect**

With an autonomous agent, your job changes fundamentally. You define the "what" and the "why," and you let the AI figure out the "how." It plans, codes, tests, and revises—all on its own. You're no longer down in the weeds; you're at the 30,000-foot view, ensuring the project is heading in the right direction.

The power you gain here is immense. While an agent is grinding away on a new feature, you're free to tackle the work that truly requires human insight: architecting the next big system, talking to users, or planning the product roadmap. It forces you to get your own house in order—your CI/CD pipelines and end-to-end tests have to be rock-solid, as they become the guardrails for your AI team.

But let's be real: autonomy without oversight is just chaos. Giving an AI agent unchecked power is like handing a new hire the production keys on day one. Your new role as a supervisor is mission-critical. You become the architect, and the AIs are your master builders. They handle the complex labor, but you own the blueprint.

## **The Workflow: building an autonomous debugging agent**

So, what does this look like in the real world? Let's build an autonomous agent with a single, high-level goal: *"Watch our production error logs. When a critical bug appears, find the root cause, write a fix, and open a pull request."*

**Step 1: The Trigger**
It starts with an AI-powered command-line tool that is set up to monitor a stream of production logs. When a critical exception appears, the agent is automatically triggered.

**Step 2: The Investigation**
A large language model, on its own, is a brain in a jar: brilliant but trapped. To do anything, it needs to interact with the world. This is where **Model-Centric Protocols (MCPs)** come in. Think of an MCP as a universal API adapter for AI—a secure layer that lets a model use an external tool.

Our agent uses an MCP for GitHub to securely access the codebase. It reads the stack trace from the error log, pinpoints the exact lines of faulty code in the repository, and analyzes the surrounding logic to understand the root cause of the bug.

**Step 3: The Fix & Verification**
This is where safety becomes non-negotiable. You never, *ever* let an autonomous agent run free in your production environment. The agent's work must happen in a **sandbox**—an isolated, containerized environment like Docker.

Inside this padded room, the agent writes a patch to fix the bug. Then, critically, it runs the *entire* automated test suite within the sandbox. This is the guardrail. The fix is only considered valid if it not only resolves the original error but also introduces zero new regressions.

**Step 4: The Delivery**
Once the fix is fully validated, the agent uses its GitHub MCP again to perform a sequence of actions:
1. Create a new branch.
2. Commit the patched code with a clear, descriptive message.
3. Push the branch to the repository.
4. Open a pull request, neatly linking it back to the original error log that triggered the process.

The final merge into the main branch is now the only step that requires a human decision. All you have to do is review the proposed solution over your morning coffee.

## **The Payoff: building self-healing systems**

This workflow is not science fiction; it's happening right now. By combining agentic frameworks, secure MCPs, and sandboxed environments, you can delegate entire development workflows that are too complex or time-consuming for a human to manage manually.

You gain enormous leverage. The nightmare scenario of an AI going rogue is managed by building strong fences: tightly scoped API keys and sandboxes for execution. The risk of the AI producing buggy code is managed by having a great map (clear requirements) and strict guardrails (a comprehensive test suite that must pass).

Honestly, the best mental model is to think of it exactly like onboarding a new human engineer. You provide clear training, set expectations, grant limited access at first, and review their work carefully. It's the same process.

## **Conclusion: get ready for programmable intelligence**

Autonomous agents represent a revolutionary step in how we build software. We've moved from delegating tasks to delegating entire outcomes.

This new paradigm of delegation is a significant leap from simply [prompting an implementation](https://jterrazz.com/articles/21-guided-ai-for-developers) line by line. It builds on the [foundational idea](https://jterrazz.com/articles/20-the-four-levels-of-ai) that the biggest wins come from handing off a complete goal. The journey culminates in [designing the intelligence](https://jterrazz.com/articles/23-programming-intelligence) itself, where we move beyond supervising AI and start programming its core reasoning.
