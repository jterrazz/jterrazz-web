# Mastering Hash Functions in C: Unraveling the Mysteries of SHA-256 and MD5

**Ever wondered how your online transactions stay secure or how your passwords remain protected?** The secret lies in the world of cryptographic hash functions. Today, we're going to demystify two of the most widely used algorithms: MD5 and SHA-256. Buckle up, because we're about to embark on a thrilling journey into the heart of digital security!

Not only will you gain a deep understanding of these algorithms, but you'll also learn how to implement them yourself in C. And if you're feeling adventurous, we've got a GitHub repository with a complete implementation waiting for you to explore. **Ready to become a cryptography wizard? Let's dive in!**

## üîê Cryptographic Functions: The Unsung Heroes of Digital Security

Imagine cryptographic functions as the silent guardians of the digital world. They're the vigilant sentinels that:

-   Ensure the **integrity** of your messages and files, making sure they haven't been tampered with.
-   Verify passwords **without ever storing them in plain text** (sneaky, right?).
-   Create the foundation for **"proof of work"** in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
-   Generate and verify **digital signatures**, the virtual equivalent of your handwritten signature.

These digital alchemists take a message of any size and transform it into a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash. It's like turning a novel into a unique fingerprint! For instance:

-   MD5 produces 128-bit hashes (16 characters in hexadecimal)
-   SHA-256 creates 256-bit hashes (32 characters in hexadecimal)

### The Superpowers of Cryptographic Hash Functions

These functions possess some truly remarkable properties:

1. **Determinism**: Like a loyal friend, they always produce the same output for the same input.
2. **Speed**: They're the Usain Bolt of algorithms, computing hashes quickly for inputs of any size.
3. **One-wayness**: They're master illusionists ‚Äì you can't determine the input from the hash.
4. **Collision resistance**: It's practically impossible to find two inputs that produce the same hash.
5. **Avalanche effect**: A tiny change in input causes a dramatically different hash, like a butterfly effect for data.

These properties make hash functions the Swiss Army knife of cryptography, ready for a variety of security applications.

## The Contenders: MD5 vs SHA-256

### MD5: The Retired Veteran

MD5, once a stalwart in the cryptographic world, is now like a retired superhero. While it's no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes (due to some sneaky vulnerabilities), it still has its uses:

-   Checking file integrity against unintentional corruption
-   Non-security-critical applications where speed is more important than bulletproof security

Remember: **MD5 should never be used for security-critical applications**. It's like using a plastic sword in a real duel ‚Äì not a great idea!

### SHA-256: The Modern Guardian

SHA-256, part of the SHA-2 family, is the cool younger cousin of MD5. It was developed to address the weaknesses of its predecessors (SHA-1 and SHA-0), which themselves were inspired by MD5. Talk about a family tree of algorithms!

SHA-256 is considered secure because:

-   It's computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the input from the hash.
-   It has strong collision resistance.

However, it's not recommended for password storage in databases. Why? It's a bit too quick for its own good, making it vulnerable to brute-force and [rainbow table attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). In the world of password hashing, slower can sometimes be safer!

## The Inner Workings: A Peek Behind the Cryptographic Curtain

### Step 1: Preparing the Stage (Formatting the Input)

Before the main show begins, we need to set the stage. The input message needs to be formatted to meet specific criteria:

1. The message is divided into **512-bit chunks**.
2. A "1" bit is added at the end of the message.
3. "0" bits are added to make the length a multiple of (512-64) bits.
4. The original message length is stored in the last 64 bits.

![Message Formatting](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*6Lplvsky40XwCE3zBhsjOA.png)
_The formatted message size must be a multiple of 512 bits_

![Message Formatting Code](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*X7tNVYUXas0-UeWdq6F3nA.png)

To calculate the formatted message length, we use this magical formula:

```c
aligned = (nb + (X-1)) & ~(X-1)
```

This aligns our number 'nb' to a multiple of 'X' bytes. It's like making sure everyone in a marching band is in perfect rows!

### The Endianness Enigma: Little & Big Endian

Before we dive deeper, let's talk about endianness ‚Äì the order in which bytes are arranged in computer memory. It's like the difference between reading a book left-to-right or right-to-left.

-   **Little-endian**: The least significant byte comes first.
-   **Big-endian**: The most significant byte comes first.

To convert between these two, we use a bit of binary magic:

![Endianness Conversion](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*KAcuzeZjKmuILLIBZ_E-Tg.png)

This shuffling algorithm works by swapping bytes, starting with small groups and progressively expanding. It's like a choreographed dance of bits!

### Step 2: The Grand Shuffle (Data Processing)

Now comes the main event! Both MD5 and SHA-256 divide the message into 512-bit chunks and perform a series of mathematical operations on them.

-   MD5 uses 4 32-bit buffers
-   SHA-256 uses 8 32-bit buffers

These buffers are like jugglers, constantly tossing and catching data bits in a mesmerizing performance. The exact steps differ between MD5 and SHA-256, but both involve a complex dance of bitwise operations, modular additions, and nonlinear functions.

-   [MD5 Implementation](https://github.com/jterrazz/42-ssl-md5/blob/master/src/ft_md5/md5.c)

### The Grand Finale: Building the Hash

After all the shuffling and juggling, we're left with 4 (for MD5) or 8 (for SHA-256) buffers. These buffers are the raw ingredients for our final hash.

To create the hash, we simply concatenate these buffers in their hexadecimal form. It's like assembling a puzzle where each piece is a part of the final secret code!

![Hash Assembly](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*R-HctJLm_B8QlAwseK2F_w.png)

One last twist for MD5: the buffers are in little-endian format, so we need to flip them before printing. It's like reading the last page of a book first!
