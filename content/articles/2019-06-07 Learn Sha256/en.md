## üîê Cryptographic Functions: The Unsung Heroes of Digital Security

Imagine cryptographic functions as the silent guardians of the digital world. They're the vigilant sentinels that:

- Ensure the **integrity** of your messages and files, making sure they haven't been tampered with.
- Verify passwords **without ever storing them in plain text** (sneaky, right?).
- Create the foundation for **"proof of work"** in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
- Generate and verify **digital signatures**, the virtual equivalent of your handwritten signature.

These digital alchemists take a message of any size and transform it into a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash. It's like turning a novel into a unique fingerprint! For instance:

- MD5 produces 128-bit hashes (16 characters in hexadecimal)
- SHA-256 creates 256-bit hashes (32 characters in hexadecimal)

### The Superpowers of Cryptographic Hash Functions

These functions possess some truly remarkable properties:

1. **Determinism**: Like a loyal friend, they always produce the same output for the same input.
2. **Speed**: They're the Usain Bolt of algorithms, computing hashes quickly for inputs of any size.
3. **One-wayness**: They're master illusionists‚Äìyou can't determine the input from the hash.
4. **Collision resistance**: It's practically impossible to find two inputs that produce the same hash.
5. **Avalanche effect**: A tiny change in input causes a dramatically different hash, like a butterfly effect for data.

These properties make hash functions the Swiss Army knife of cryptography, ready for a variety of security applications.

## The Contenders: MD5 Vs SHA-256

### MD5: The Retired Veteran

MD5, once a stalwart in the cryptographic world, is now like a retired superhero. While it's no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes (due to some sneaky vulnerabilities), it still has its uses:

- Checking file integrity against unintentional corruption
- Non-security-critical applications where speed is more important than bulletproof security

Remember: **MD5 should never be used for security-critical applications**. It's like using a plastic sword in a real duel‚Äìnot a great idea!

### SHA-256: The Modern Guardian

SHA-256, part of the SHA-2 family, is the cool younger cousin of MD5. It was developed to address the weaknesses of its predecessors (SHA-1 and SHA-0), which themselves were inspired by MD5. Talk about a family tree of algorithms!

SHA-256 is considered secure because:

- It's computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the input from the hash.
- It has strong collision resistance.

However, it's not recommended for password storage in databases. Why? It's a bit too quick for its own good, making it vulnerable to brute-force and [rainbow table attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). In the world of password hashing, slower can sometimes be safer!

## The Inner Workings: A Peek Behind the Cryptographic Curtain

### Step 1: Preparing the Stage (Formatting the Input)

Before the main show begins, we need to set the stage. The input message needs to be formatted to meet specific criteria:

1. The message is divided into **512-bit chunks**.
2. A "1" bit is added at the end of the message.
3. "0" bits are added to make the length a multiple of (512-64) bits.
4. The original message length is stored in the last 64 bits.

![Message Formatting](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*6Lplvsky40XwCE3zBhsjOA.png)
_The formatted message size must be a multiple of 512 bits_

```c
unsigned char build_msg(const char msg, size_t msg_len, size_t formatted_msg_len, bool is_little_endian)
{
  unsigned char  formatted_msg;
  size_t         cursor;

  if (! (formatted_msg = malloc(formatted_msg_len)))
    return (NULL) ;

  ft_memcpy(formatted_msg, msg, msg_len);
  formatted_msg[msg_len]   = 0b10000000;
  cursor = msg_len + 1;

  while (cursor < formatted_msg_len)
    formatted_msg[cursor++] = 0;

  (uint64_t )(formatted_msg + cursor - 8) =
    is_little_endian ? 8 + msg_len : ft_bswap_uint64(8, msg_len);

  return (formatted_msg);
}
```

To calculate the formatted message length, we use this magical formula:

```c
aligned = (nb + (X-1)) & ~(X-1)
```

This aligns our number 'nb' to a multiple of 'X' bytes. It's like making sure everyone in a marching band is in perfect rows!

```c
#define DEC(x) (x - 1)

// Chunks of 512 bits
#define MD5_CHUNK_SIZE 64

// +1 for the appended '1'
// +8 for the size in 64 bits
#define MD5_CHUNKS_SIZE(len) (len + 1 + 8 + DEC(MD5_CHUNK_SIZE) ) &
~DEC(MD5_CHUNK_SIZE)
#define MD5_CHUNK_COUNT(len) (MD5_CHUNKS_SIZE(len) / MD5_CHUNK_SIZE)

formatted_msg_len = CHUNK_SIZE x CHUNK_COUNT;
```

### The Endianness Enigma: Little & Big Endian

Before we dive deeper, let's talk about endianness‚Äìthe order in which bytes are arranged in computer memory. It's like the difference between reading a book left-to-right or right-to-left.

- **Little-endian**: The least significant byte comes first.
- **Big-endian**: The most significant byte comes first.

[üîó Dive deeper into the endianness rabbit hole](https://medium.com/@nonuruzun/little-big-endian-dc9abe36270?source=post_page-----78c17e657794--------------------------------)

To convert between these two, we use a bit of binary magic:

```c
uint64_t  ft_bswap_uint64(uint64_t x)
{
  x = ((x < 8) & 0XFF00FF00FF00FF00ULL ) | ((x >> 8) & 0X00FF00FF00FF00FFULL);
  x = ((x < 16) & 0xFFFF0000FFFF0000ULL) | ((x >> 16) &
0x0000FFFF0000FFFFULL);

  return (x < 32) | (x >> 32) ;
}
```

This shuffling algorithm works by swapping bytes, starting with small groups and progressively expanding. It's like a choreographed dance of bits!

### Step 2: The Grand Shuffle (Data Processing)

Now comes the main event! Both MD5 and SHA-256 divide the message into 512-bit chunks and perform a series of mathematical operations on them.

- MD5 uses 4 32-bit buffers
- SHA-256 uses 8 32-bit buffers

These buffers are like jugglers, constantly tossing and catching data bits in a mesmerizing performance. The exact steps differ between MD5 and SHA-256, but both involve a complex dance of bitwise operations, modular additions, and nonlinear functions.

- [MD5 Implementation](https://github.com/jterrazz/42-ssl-md5/blob/master/src/ft_md5/md5.c)

### The Grand Finale: Building the Hash

After all the shuffling and juggling, we're left with 4 (for MD5) or 8 (for SHA-256) buffers. These buffers are the raw ingredients for our final hash.

To create the hash, we simply concatenate these buffers in their hexadecimal form. It's like assembling a puzzle where each piece is a part of the final secret code!

```c
char build_hash(uint32_t buffers, size_t buffer_count, bool is_little_endian)
{
  char      hash;
  char      hash_tmp;
  size_t    buffer_i;
  uint32_t  buffer;
  
  buffer_i = 0;

  if (!(hash = ft_strnew(buffer_count 8)))
    return (NULL);

  while (buffer_i < buffer_count) {
    buffer = is_little_endian ? ft_bswap_uint32(buffers[buffer_i]) :
buffers[buffer_il;

    if (!(hash_tmp = ft_uitoa_base_len(buffer, 16, 'a', 8)))
      return (NULL);

    ft_strncpy(hash + (buffer_i 8), hash_tmp, 8);
    free(hash_tmp);
    buffer_i++;
  }
  
  return (hash);
}
```

One last twist for MD5: the buffers are in little-endian format, so we need to flip them before printing. It's like reading the last page of a book first!

```c
uint32_t ft_bswap_uint32(uint32_t x)
{
  x = ((x < 8) & 0xFF00FF00) | ((x > 8) & 0xFF00FF);
  
  return (x << 16) (x >> 16);
}
```
