# Dive into Assembly: Crafting Your First Functions (Intel x86‚Äì64 syntax)

Ever wondered what's happening under the hood of your computer? While C is often considered a low-level language, it still abstracts many of the **raw instructions** executed by your processor. That's where Assembly comes in‚Äìthe language that speaks directly to your machine's heart. üñ•Ô∏èüíì

In this article, we'll equip you with the essential tools to understand and create your own Assembly functions. So, put on your hard hat, and let's start building! üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüîß

## Getting Started: The Assembly Playground

Assembly language varies depending on your processor's architecture. We'll focus on the Intel x86‚Äì64 syntax, the lingua franca of most desktop computers.

### Your Toolkit: NASM and Friends

To begin your Assembly adventure, you'll need:

1. A text editor (your trusty code sword ‚öîÔ∏è)
2. The NASM compiler (your magic wand for transforming Assembly into machine code ü™Ñ)

Here's how you use NASM:

```sh
# Install nasm on MacOS
brew install nasm

# Compile assembly files
nasm -f macho64 <asm_file>.s -o <object_file>.o
ar rcs <exec_name> <object_files>
```

> **Pro Tip:** The `-f` argument specifies the output format. For instance, `macho64` is the format for modern macOS executables.

### Debugging: Your Assembly Detective Kit üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

As you venture deeper into Assembly, debugging tools will become your best friends. Get acquainted with `lldb` and `gdb`‚Äìthey'll help you solve the mysteries of your code.

## The Language of the Machine

Assembly is like a choreographed dance of commands for your processor. Each line represents a single step‚Äìone instruction for your CPU to execute.

### Assembly vs. Machine Code: Not Twins, but Close Cousins

A common misconception is that Assembly and machine code are identical. While they're closely related, they're not the same:

- **Machine Code:** The binary language your computer ultimately executes.
- **Assembly:** A human-readable representation that still requires compilation.

Assembly offers several advantages:

1. **Readability:** Easier for humans to understand
2. **Structure:** Allows for better program organization (variables, macros, sections)
3. **Abstraction:** A thin layer above raw binary, but still very close to the metal

### Anatomy of an Assembly File

An Assembly file (`.s`) is typically divided into four main sections:

```python
# SECTION: Initialized data
.data
my_str db "001101" # You can save strings and adds the terminating /0     
my_var db 0 # The integer i is initialized to 0
# db 1 declares 1 byte (b = byte)
# dw 1 declares 2 bytes (w = word)
# dd 1 declares 4 bytes (d = doubleword)
# dq 1 declares 8 bytes (q = quadword)

# SECTION: Constant data
.rodata
my_var db 6
# Same as .data but the data can't be changed

# SECTION: Uninitialized data     
.bss
my_var: resb 4 # Allocates 4 uninitialized bytes
# resb 1 allocates 1 byte (b = byte)
# resw 1 allocates 2 bytes (w = word)
# resd 1 allocates 4 bytes (d = doubleword)
# resq 1 allocates 8 bytes (q = quadword)
```

1. **data:** Initialized data storage
2. **rodata:** Read-only data (constants)
3. **bss:** Uninitialized data storage
4. **text:** Where the actual code logic resides

If no section is specified, `.text` is the default‚Äìthat's where the action happens!

### Memory: Your Assembly Playground

In the world of Assembly, you have three types of memory at your disposal:

1. **Registers:** Lightning-fast, but limited in number
2. **Memory Addresses (RAM):** Vast storage, but slower to access
3. **Constants:** Immutable values embedded in your code

### The Register Family

Registers are like the VIP lounge of memory‚Äìexclusive and fast. Here are the key players:

#### General-Purpose Registers

- `rax`, `rbx`, `rcx`, `rdx`: The workhorses of Assembly instructions
		- `a`: Accumulator (often for arithmetic)
		- `b`: Base (often for memory addressing)
		- `c`: Counter (loops, anyone?)
		- `d`: Data (general data operations)

#### Index Registers

- `EDI`: Destination index
- `ESI`: Source index
- `EBP`: Stack base pointer
- `ESP`: Stack pointer
- `EIP`: Instruction pointer (next instruction's address)

#### Segment Registers

For simple functions, you can usually ignore these: `CS`, `DS`, `SS`, `ES`, `FS`, `GS`

## The Assembly Instruction Set: Your Programming Toolkit

Each line in Assembly is a single instruction, typically following this format:

```asm
COMMAND ARG1, ARG2
```

Let's explore some essential instructions:

### Data Movement: The Assembly Shuffle

**mov**‚Äî`<dst> [reg, mem]`, `<src> [reg, mem, const]`
Copies data from `src` to `dst`. It's like teleportation for data! üåü

**push**‚Äî`<data> [reg, mem, const]`
Adds data to the top of the stack. Think of it as stacking plates.

**pop**‚Äî`<dst> [reg, mem]`
Removes the top item from the stack and puts it in `dst`. Like taking the top plate off the stack.

**lea**‚Äî`<dst> [reg]`, `[<src>] [mem]`
"Load Effective Address"‚ÄìSaves the address of `src` in the register. It's like remembering where you put something without actually moving it.

### Math Operations: Assembly Arithmetic

**add**‚Äî`<dst> [reg]`, `<src> [reg]`
Adds `src` to `dst` and stores the result in `dst`.

**sub**‚Äî`<dst> [reg]`, `<src> [reg]`
Subtracts `src` from `dst` and saves the result in `dst`.

**dec**‚Äî`<dst> [reg]`
Decreases the given register by 1. It's like a tiny countdown.

**inc**‚Äî`<dst> [reg]`
Increases the given register by 1. Small steps, big results!

### Control Flow: Navigating Your Code

**call**‚Äî`<function_name>`
Calls a function. It's like shouting "Hey, function_name, do your thing!"

```python
extern malloc

.text
call malloc # We will see arguments in the calling convention section

# Result is stored in rax
```

**jmp**‚Äî`<dst_location>`
Unconditional jump to a section. Like teleporting in your code!

```python
.text

my_section_1:
...
jmp my_section_2 # Go at my_section_2
... # Will be skipped

my_section_2:
jmp my_section_1 # Go at my_section_1
```

**j<condition>**‚Äî`<dst_location>`
Conditional jump. It's like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" for your code.

### Comparison and Testing

**cmp**‚Äî`<reg0> [reg]`, `<reg1> [reg]`
Compares `reg0` and `reg1`, setting flags for conditional jumps.

**test**‚Äî`<reg0> [reg]`, `<reg1> [reg]`
Performs a bitwise AND between `reg0` and `reg1`, setting flags.

```python
extern ft_ isalpha
extern ft_isdigit

.text
_ft_isalnum:
call _ft_isalpha # Returns 1 in rax if isalpha
test rax, rax
jnz is_alnum # If not 0, then jump

call _ft_isdigit # Returns 1 in rax if isdigit
test rax, rax
jnz is_alnum # If not 0, then jump

is_not_ alnum:
xor rax, rax # Sets return to 0
ret

is_alnum:
mov rax, 1 # Sets return to 1
ret
```

**ret**
Ends the function and returns to the caller. Like saying "My job here is done!"

## Calling Conventions: The Assembly Etiquette

When functions talk to each other in Assembly, they follow certain rules. For example, arguments are often passed in this order: `%rdi`, `%rsi`, `%rdx`, `%rcx`, `%r8`, and `%r9`.

### Syscalls: Talking to the Kernel

The kernel provides many system calls for interacting with the OS. It's like having a direct hotline to the core of your computer!

## Putting It All Together: A Simple Example

Let's look at a basic Assembly function: `ft_isascii`

![ft_isascii function](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Zeu7RMnWR6HT_7ij3-9kVA.png)

This function checks if a given character is within the ASCII range. It's like a bouncer for the ASCII club! üö´üéâ
