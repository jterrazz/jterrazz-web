# Demystifying Expert Systems: Implementing a Backward Chaining Resolver in Python

Have you ever wondered how computers can mimic human decision-making? Enter the world of **expert systems**â€“powerful tools that reproduce cognitive mechanisms to solve complex problems. These systems are the unsung heroes behind many AI applications, quietly working their magic in fields ranging from medical diagnosis to financial planning.

In this article, we'll dive into the fascinating realm of expert systems and learn how to implement a backward chaining resolver using Python. By the end, you'll have the knowledge to create your own miniature AI brain! ðŸ§ ðŸ’»

## What is an Expert System?

An expert system is like a digital Sherlock Holmes. It uses a set of **facts and rules** to deduce answers to queries, much like our favorite detective uses clues to solve mysteries. This **deduction system** is invaluable for decision-making and proving hypotheses, serving as a cornerstone in the grand edifice of artificial intelligence.

## The Building Blocks of Our Expert System

### Rules: The Logical Lego Pieces

![Rules Visualization](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*3618kjRpRPZ8yUwjTEa9SA.png)

At the heart of our expert system lie the **rules**. Think of them as logical Lego pieces that we can combine to build complex reasoning structures. These rules are equations that mix `facts` (represented by uppercase letters) with `connectors`:

- `&`: **AND**â€”The Swiss Army knife of logic. All operands must be `True`.
- `|`: **OR**â€”The easy-going connector. Only one operand needs to be `True`.
- `^`: **XOR**â€”The picky eater. One operand must be `True`, but not both.
- `=>`: **IMPLY**â€”The "if-then" mastermind. If the left side is `True`, the right side must follow suit.

### The Inference Truth Table: Logic's Cheat Sheet

![Inference Truth Table](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*aZ-xKiHeAcPBCnP2bgcOTQ.png)

This table is our logical compass. It guides us through the treacherous waters of inference. For instance, in the case of `p => q`, if `p` is `false`, `q` becomes a wild cardâ€“it could be either `true` or `false`. But if `p` is `true`, `q` must toe the line and be `true` as well.

### Facts and Queries: The System's Input and Output

![Facts and Queries](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*qr7VSqmln95Si329hAIX4A.png)

**Facts** are the building blocks of our knowledge base, represented by uppercase letters. By default, they're all false (our system is a bit pessimistic). A fact can become true either through initial declaration (`=XXX`) or by logical deduction from the rules.

**Queries**, marked with `?XXX`, are the questions we pose to our digital oracle.

## Crafting the Resolver: A Tale of Two Approaches

### Forward vs. Backward Chaining: Choose Your Adventure

When it comes to solving an expert system, we have two paths:

1. **Forward chaining**: The eager beaver approach. We start with the facts and work our way to the conclusion.
2. **Backward chaining**: The lazy genius method. We begin with the hypothesis and trace back to the supporting facts.

In this article, we'll focus on the backward resolver. It's like solving a mystery novel by starting with the last page!

## The Data Structure: Building Our Logical Lego Set

### The Node Class: The Versatile Building Block

```python
class Node:
  def __init__(self):
    self.children = [] # In A => B, => is child of B 
    self.visited = False # When recursively parsing the Graph, it avoids infinite loop
    self.state = False # Saves if the result is True
```

Nodes are the Swiss Army knives of our system. They handle logic, store states, and connect with other nodes through the `children` list. For example, in the rule `A => B`, `A` is the child of `=>`, which is the child of `B`. If `A` is true, we can deduce that `B` is true.

### AtomNode and ConnectorNode: The Specialized Tools

```python
class AtomNode(Node):
  def __init__(self, name):
    super(AtomNode, self).__init__()
    self.name = name
```

```python
class ConnectorNode(Node):
  def __init__(self, connector_type):
    super(ConnectorNode, self).__init__(tree)
    self.type = connector_type
    self.operands = [] # For example, in A + B, A and B are operands of +
    self.state = None
```

These classes inherit from the Node class, adding specialized behaviors for atoms (like A, B, C) and connectors (AND, XOR, OR, IMPLY).

## The Resolver: Bringing It All Together

### Step 1: Creating a Unique Atom List

First, we parse the input and create a list of unique atoms. It's like creating a cast of characters for our logical playâ€“each letter in different rules points to the same `AtomNode` instance.

### Step 2: The RPN Magic

![RPN Representation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*m27ch2wzXuwq6C0FLKAlqw.png)

We use the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) to represent our rules. It's like writing a recipe where you list the ingredients before the cooking method. This notation has several perks:

- It maintains the order of operands
- You read it from left to right (no more mental gymnastics!)
- Operands vanish as they're used, replaced by the calculated value

### Step 3: Connecting the Dots

```python
stack = []

for x in npi_rule:
  if x not in OPERATORS:
    stack.append(self.atoms[x])
  else:
    pop0 = stack.pop()
    pop1 = stack.pop()
    # If one of the popped element is the same connector that we will create (AND, OR, XOR)
    if isinstance(pop0, ConnectorNode) and pop0.type is LST_OP[x]:
      pop0.add_operand(pop1)
      new_connector = pop0
      self.connectors.pop()
    elif isinstance(pop1, ConnectorNode) and pop1.type is LST_OP[x]:
      pop1.add_operand(pop0)
      new_connector = pop1
      self.connectors.pop()
    else:
      connector_x = self.create_connector(LST_OP[x])
      connector_x.add_operands([pop0, pop1])
      new_connector = connector_x
    self.connectors.append(new_connector)
    stack.append(new_connector)

return stack.pop()
```

We create relationships between nodes, building our logical network.

### Step 4: The Grand Finale - Resolving Queries

```python
# Pseudocode

def resolve(nodeX):
  if nodeX is True:
    return True
  
  for child in nodeX.children:
    res = resolve(child)
    if res is True:
      # Only need on of the chlid to be True for deducting the current is True
      return True
    
  if Node is Connector: # AND OR XOR IMPLY
    op_results = []
    for op in nodeX.operands:
      op_results.append(resolve(op))
    self.set_state_from_operands(op_results)
    # Example: for AND all op_results elements must be True
```

Finally, we put our system to work, resolving the queries and unveiling the logical truths hidden within our rules and facts.
