# Master Memory Management: Create Your Own malloc Library from Scratch

Are you curious about **how dynamically allocated memory works** ? I was too, so I decided to build my own malloc implementation.

In this article, I‚Äôll share everything you need to know about `malloc` ‚Äî why it exists, how it works, and how to build it yourself using `mmap/munmap` functions and memory handling algorithms. I‚Äôve even included my completed project on GitHub for you to reference. Join me in learning about memory management by building your own malloc library! üë∑

## Memory management

C manages variables in memory, but there are some limitations to this.

-   **Static and global variables** are stored in main memory along with the program‚Äôs executable code and they remain there for the entire duration of the program.
-   **Automatic duration variables**, like a local `int` variable in a function, are stored on the stack and are created and destroyed every time a function is called or returned.

This can be problematic for 2 reasons:

-   Because the **size of the allocation must be set at compile time**
-   Because the **lifespan of a variable can‚Äôt be adjusted** ‚Äî it‚Äôs not possible to choose when to create or delete them.

### Dynamic allocation and mmap

Fortunately, the **UNIX kernel** provides a **system call** that allows us to allocate memory with a specified size. In this article, we‚Äôll be using the `mmap()` function to **map physical memory to virtual addresses** and get a pointer to the start, but you can also use sbrk. `mmap` is a great tool for managing memory and virtual addresses.

### Here comes malloc

**If `mmap` can return a memory zone, why do we need** `malloc` **?** System calls are time-consuming and most programs often request and release a large amount of memory frequently. Making a system call every time would greatly reduce performance.

Malloc helps to solve this problem by acting as a**performance wrapper** around `mmap` . We can preallocate more memory than needed to avoid system calls, at the cost of a small memory overhead. New malloc calls will use the reallocated space until more space is required.

## Implementation

### The library

The `malloc` library allocates a block of memory and returns a pointer to its start. When the program is finished with the memory, the pointer is passed to `free()` to release it. `realloc` increases or decreases the size of a `malloc` pointer and **preserves its data**, returning a new pointer.

### Data structure

A memory zone allocated by `mmap` is called a **heap** . The heap is filled with **blocks** . Both heaps and blocks have metadata at their start. The following is the structure of a heap with one block (_resulting from a single call to malloc_ ).

_We can use the following metadata structures:_

By **chaining** blocks with `next` and `prev` pointers, we can iterate through the heap and access any block. C structures always have a fixed size, which we can use to move safely from a metadata pointer to the start of the data. This helps us manage the heap and blocks effectively.

### Performance

To **efficiently preallocate memory**, we categorize blocks into **3 sizes** : `SMALL`, `TINY`, and `LARGE` . As a general rule, at least 100 `SMALL` and `TINY` blocks should fit inside their own heap. Larger blocks, on the other hand, are not preallocated.

It‚Äôs more efficient to use a multiple of `getpagesize()` when defining the size of a `heap`. For example, on my system the page size is 4096 bytes (_run_ `getconf PAGE_SIZE` ).

Let‚Äôs say we use 128 bytes as the maximum size for tiny blocks. If we fill a heap with 128 of them, it gives us a TINY_HEAP_ALLOCATION_SIZE of 16KB (128 \* 128). However, since each malloc must store its metadata (sizeof(t_block) = 32 bytes), we won‚Äôt be able to fit all 128 blocks in the heap. 16 KB / (128 + 32) = 102.4, so we can fit **102 128-byte mallocs in the 16KB heap**, including the `t_heap` at the start of the `heap`.

Let‚Äôs use the following values:

### The malloc algorithm

When `malloc` is called, it searches for an available space and returns its address. However, since the virtual addresses of old blocks can‚Äôt be changed, we must manage free space that may be **fragmented** between them. To do this:

-   Malloc searches for a **reference** to the `heap list` (if it exists) and stores it in a global variable.
-   It goes through each heap to try and **fill a freed space** using the first fit strategy ‚Äî it iterates through each block from start to end until it finds a freed block with enough space.
-   If no suitable block is found, malloc appends a new block to the end of the last `heap`.
-   If the last heap doesn‚Äôt have enough available space, the algorithm creates a new heap by calling `mmap`.

### Free and the fragmentation problem

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Y7xikxHO1Yoyv1eZm7l6aA.png)

When the `free` function is called, the program sets the status of the requested block to **freed**. However, since the virtual addresses of blocks can‚Äôt be changed, we often end up with **fragmented freed memory** in the heap (as shown in the graph above).

-   If `block->prev->freed || block->next->freed`, we merge them.
-   It was the last `block` in the `heap`, we `munmap` to release memory to the system (but we must still keep one preallocated)

### Realloc

Realloc is essentially the same as calling **malloc + memcpy + free** .

If the requested space is zero, the behavior is implementation-defined. I chose to implement a ‚Äúlazy‚Äù version that simply returns ptr. However, it‚Äôs important to note that `realloc(ptr, 0)` should not be used as a replacement for free.

## Testing

The best way to test our malloc is to use it in usual commands, like `ls` or `vim`. Create the following `run.sh` file and execute it before the desired command `sh run.sh ${CMD}`.

### Align memory on MacOS

I had difficulty understanding why certain commands, like `vim`, would cause a **segmentation fault** on my system. It turns out that the **MacOS** `malloc` aligns data on **16 bytes** . To implement this, simply set `size = (size + 15) & ~15`.

I hope that this has helped you gain a better understanding of the malloc library.
