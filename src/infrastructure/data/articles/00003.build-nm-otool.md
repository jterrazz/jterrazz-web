# Everything you need to build your own nm and otool

Did you ever asked how your computer decodes binaries ? Lately I wanted to learn this concept, and that‚Äôs why I decided to implement the **_nm_** and **_otool_** commands. In C, with the most basic functions, these two programs made me understand a lot about binaries and Unix. Those interested in the field might learn a few concepts here.

This article should have all the ressources needed to build your own implementations. I strongly advise you to try doing this project by yourself. You will gain a lot of skills exploring the **man** and system **header files**.

_This implementation covers \*\*\_Mach-O_\*\*, the current executable format for MacOS.\_

[Feel free to access the complete GitHub project](https://github.com/jterrazz/42-nm-otool?source=post_page-----7d4fef3d7507--------------------------------).

## Executables

When the operating system **starts a binary**, it will expect the file to follow a **predefined pattern**. Each operating systems has their own conventions. In this article, we will focus on the `Mach-O` format, the one used by modern MacOS computers. Other conventions exist, for example Linux mainly uses `ELF` and Windows `PE`. You can find a complete list here.

[The following document gives you a complete reference in case you want to understand this in depth.](https://github.com/aidansteele/osx-abi-macho-file-format-reference?source=post_page-----7d4fef3d7507--------------------------------)

### 1st step: Identify a mach-o file

The **first byte** of a file usually defines its identity: it‚Äôs called the **magic number**. By comparing it to a list of known magic numbers, we can deduct if the file follows a Mach-O pattern. To get these constants you can include the file `<mach-o/loader.h>` in your project.

Those 4 magic numbers identify mach-o files. They differ because of their **structure size** (32‚Äì64 bits) and their **endianness**.

### Big endian or little endian??

## Nm and otool

So why are we implementing `nm` and `otool` ?

Those commands are great to learn about `mach-o` files because they **parse, analyse their structure** and then display the data.

-   `nm` displays a list of **symbols** of an executable.
-   `otool` displays the hexdumped data of a specified segment. We will see what is a segment later.

## Parsing the structure

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*gMKkvCSZXsGeVC0tH6PQ6w.png)

### Access the file

We will first access and read the file. I use a simple combinaison of `open, fstat, mmap` and `close` to get a pointer to the start of the data.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*2P9advEEZER1LaLSebOucA.png)

You should check the **magic number** against the previous predefined `mach-o` magics.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*_477rmqdA6PR8WI7MKQJag.png)

The MacOS system gives us many header files that define for us the **Mach-O structures** and **constants**. We will use them in the following sections. Because `nm` and `otool` need to parse the same structures, we can code common functions.

### The header

A `mach-o` file always start with the following header:

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*lEQ1Fc-L7t3JrWsZLPaMbw.png)

It gives you much information, like a `cpu_type` ( cpus able to run this executable), the `filetype`, etc ‚Ä¶

### Load commands

The load commands divide data of the binary in multiple sections. You can get the complete list of types of load commands in the loader.h header, under LC_XXX names. For this article, you‚Äôll only need the `LC_SYMTAB` and `LC_SEGMENT` commands.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*BUqYPFgEHwtK4w5CvaKkmA.png)

Because the load commands are placed after each other, we can iterate thought them using their size.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*N5X6RsMxix8S5hvZc90tJw.png)

`otool` print the content of some sections in the command `LC_SEGMENT`. For `nm`, we have to match items in the command `LC_SYMTAB` to their related`LC_SEGMENT` section.

#### LC_SEGMENT ‚Äî The segment command

The segment commands tell where to find a segment in memory, and the number of bytes to allocate for it. It also specifies the number of sections it contains.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*yCDINaWcuLYaNFOxAXRQ0g.png)

At `lc->fileoff` we find the start of the segment. It also start with a **header,** followed by the list of `nsects` sections. A section is characterized by its section name (`__text` for example) and segment name (`__TEXT` for example), the address of its related data in memory, the data size, etc.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Iaj8IPtZLbzeNE61m0BsGw.png)

With these information, we can iterate through them. With `otool`, you have to **hexdump** the data at `addr`. With `nm` you must save the segment to **match it later with a symbol** in the `SYMTAB`. For that we need a new parameter: the id of the segment, so dont forget to save it. For example, if it‚Äôs the first segment in the file, it‚Äôs id is 0, etc.

### LC_SYMTAB ‚Äî The symbol table command

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Z2AszURFHXehcruzZNhosQ.png)

A `symtab_command` header is followed by a list of `nlist` symbols.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*1_ww_etKWj-RuyMo6tHddQ.png)

To get the name of a symbol, we need to parse the `strtab`. The `nlist` structure also gives us many useful information.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*Ib35tK7AbIyH_YPS6QhmJw.png)

What do we need to build a line for `nm` ? The first column shows the **address**, second one gives a letter describing the **symbol type** : for example `T` for an exported methods, `U` are external methods. The complete list is available below.

### nm(1): symbols from object files ‚Äî Linux man page

Here is how to get the representation for a symbol.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*UfyfZl05EnTvTL9S2L0MlA.png)

When the N_SECT mask is true with `sect->type`, we must find the type based on the given segment. Remember you saved the id of our sections ? You can use it here üòâ

## Go further

Look at you ! You should now be able to build you own nm and otool üòé. But wait, if you‚Äôre serious about this project you still need to handle some edge cases. I will briefly talk about 4 of them.

### Archives and fat files

Parsing those files is not complicated if you followed the previous steps. The headers are available at `<mach-o/fat.h>` and `<ar.h>`. The process is the same.

### Support for little/big endian

Variables stored on the headers might differ on how they‚Äôre stored. When you read the values of integers, you sometimes need to **reverse their bits order**.

### Support for 64 and 32 bits

Sometimes the header will give you a 64 bits integer, be prepared to handle it.

### Secure against corrupt files üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

This part is a bit more complicated and requires some testing. I always consider that a program should never `segfault`.

In the case you receive a corrupted binary, the program could try to access a memory location that is not available. For every time you move a pointer based on file values, I suggest you to check if it never goes before the start of file, or after the end of it.
