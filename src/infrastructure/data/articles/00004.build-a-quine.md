# Build a self replicating program (quine)

The rules are simple, build a program that **outputs its source code**. Opening and reading the source file is considered **cheating**. More precisely, a quine receiving any kind of input is considered **invalid**.

## The Kleeneâ€™s theorem

This exercise is a direct application of the Kleeneâ€™s theorem. But the theorem was created long before computers. Here is how I understand it.

### First form â€” The fixed-point theorem

It says that for **every** **conditional program** `e`, there is a program true for `Ï•e(x) = f(e,x)` for any input `x`. `e` is the program logic, and `Ï•e` its syntax. It means that there is one program which execution will result in its source code.

### Second form

From this we can deduct its **second form**, which states that for every conditional program, **there is one program which execution will result in the same program**.

## Letâ€™s build one

Letâ€™s build your first simple quine. You have to print the source code of your program without opening it, use at least 2 comments and two functions. A `diff <(./quine) quine.c` should return nothing.

### Solution in C

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/*
   Hey, this is an outside comment
*/

char *get_str()
{
	return "#include <stdio.h>%1$c%1$c/*%1$c   Hey, this is an outside comment%1$c*/%1$c%1$cchar *get_str()%1$c{%1$c%2$creturn %3$c%4$s%3$c;%1$c}%1$c%1$cint main(void)%1$c{%1$c%2$c/*%1$c%2$c   Hey, this is an inside comment%1$c%2$c*/%1$c%2$cchar *str = get_str();%1$c%2$cprintf(str, 10, 9, 34, str);%1$c}%1$c";
}

int main(void)
{
	/*
	   Hey, this is an inside comment
	*/
	char *str = get_str();
	printf(str, 10, 9, 34, str);
}
```

## Good to know

This type of programs was named Quine in honor of the philosopher Willard Van Orman Quine, who worked on the subject of indirect self-reference.
