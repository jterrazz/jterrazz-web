# Quickly code your first assembly functions (Intel x86‚Äì64 syntax)

While C could be considered a low level language, its syntax still abstracts a lot of the **instructions** made by your processor. That‚Äôs why you might want to learn about the lower level programming languages, like Assembly.

This article will give you the basic tools to understand Assembly functions so that you can create your own üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Getting started

The language differs depending of your processor‚Äôs architecture. In the following sections, I will focus on the Intel x86‚Äì64 syntax, used by most of the desktop computers.

### The tools

You can write your assembly code inside `.s` files and compile them with the `nasm` compiler.

### Debug

Once you begin coding your own functions, I highly recommend you to get familiar with debugging tools such as `lldb` and `gdb`.

## The language

The assembly language describes the **succession of commands** your processor will execute. One line means one instruction.

### Machine code

One common mistake is to think the assembly language is the same as machine code. Machine code is the **binary** executed by the computer. Assembly still requires **compilation,** has the advantage to be more **readable** by humans, and is better for structuring your program (with variable names, macros, sections, etc).

### The file structure and static data regions

A `.s` file can be divided by 4 types of sections: `data`, `rodata`, `bss`, `text`. If none is given, the default is `text`.

The 3 static data regions are described above. The `.text` section stores the code logic. The next sections will describe how you can build that logic.

### Access memory

At your disposition you have 3 types of memory: registers, memory addresses (RAM) and constants. Register are very fast but you only have a dozen at your disposition. Memory addresses can store a lot of data but are slower.

### General registers

`rax, rbx, rcx, rdx` They are used by most of the instructions. Their names don‚Äôt really matter but here are their signification.

-   `a` : Accumulator register
-   `b` : Base register
-   `c` : Counter register
-   `d` : Data register

### Indexes registers

-   `EDI` : Destination register
-   `ESI` : Source register
-   `EBP` : Stack base Pointer
-   `ESP` : Stack pointer register
-   `EIP` : Index pointer, saves the pointer of the next instruction

### Segment registers

You probably won‚Äôt need them for simple functions: `CS` (code segment), `DS` (data segment), `SS` (stack segment), `ES` `FS` `GS`

## Instructions

Each line represents one instruction. Usually you have the command identifier followed by the arguments.

`CMD ARG1, ARG2`

### Moving values

**_mov_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg, mem]*` _,_ `<src> [reg, mem, const]*`

It copies the data item referred in `src` into the location of `dst`. However you cannot copy data between 2 memory addresses `mov mem0, mem1` ( you can do it by using two instruction and one register).

**_push_** _‚Äî_ `<data> [reg, mem, const]*`

Push data to the stack (more about the stack).

**_pop_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg, mem]*`

Pop the first value available in the stack to `dst`.

**_lea_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg]*` _,_ `*[&lt;src>] [mem]*`

Stands for ‚Äúload effective address‚Äù. It saves the address of `src` in the given register.

### Mathematical operations

**_add_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg]*` _,_ `<src> [reg]*`

Adds `dst` and `src` and saves the result in `dst`.

**_sub_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg]*` _,_ `<src> [reg]*`

Substract `dst` and `src` and saves the result in `dst`.

**_dec_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg]*`

Decreases by 1 the given register.

**_inc_** _‚Äî_ `<dst> [reg]*`

Increases by 1 the given register.

### Control Flow Instructions

**_call_** _‚Äî_ `<function_name>*` _‚Äî Call a function_

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*SrMUyVoSFA102ujMnn4X1A.png)

**_jmp_** _‚Äî_ `<dst_location>*` _‚Äî Jump to a section_

Transfers the execution to the instruction given in the operand.

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*DqE7QBS4MnpQ72pMfZOzJg.png)

**_j&lt;condition>_** _‚Äî_ `<dst_location>*` _‚Äî Jump to a section if conditions are met_

Same as `jmp` but only if the condition is true. The complete condition list is available here.

### Testing and comparing values

**_cmp_** _‚Äî_ `<reg0> [reg]*` _,_ `<reg1> [reg]*` _‚Äî Set conditions codes for_ `*reg1-reg0*`

**_test_** _‚Äî_ `<reg0> [reg]*` _,_ `<reg1> [reg]*` _‚Äî Set conditions codes for_ `*reg0 &amp; reg1*`

**_ret_** ‚Äî End the function

## The calling conventions

Many conventions exists. For example arguments are usually passed in this order `%rdi, %rsi, %rdx, %rcx, %r8 and %r9`. For more detail, access the link below.

### Syscalls

The kernel gives you many system calls. The complete list is here.

### Memory and the stack

This subject would take an entire medium article. I‚Äôll update this article once i‚Äôve done it.
