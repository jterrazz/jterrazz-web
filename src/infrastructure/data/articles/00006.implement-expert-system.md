# Expert Systems: How to implement a backward chaining resolver in Python

An expert system is a tool capable of reproducing cognitive mechanisms. It can resolve queries from a set of known **facts and rules**. This **deduction system** is useful for decision making or when you want to prove things. It is one of the path leading to artificial intelligence systems.

This article will give you the basic concepts of a how a system like this can be solved. At the end, you should be able to implement you own backward resolver ðŸ˜Š.

## The expert system

### Rules

First the system receive a set of rules. Rules are **equations** that combine `facts` with `connectors`. `Facts` are in this case represented by uppercase letters, and `connectors` can be one of:

-   `&` : **AND** â€” All operands must be `True`.
-   `|` : **OR** â€” Only one operand need to be `True`.
-   `^` : **XOR** â€” One operand must be `True` and the other `False`.
-   `=>` : **IMPLY** â€” If the left side is `True` then the right side must be `True`.

### The inference truth table

This table describes the inferenceâ€™s logic. For example in `p => q`, if the left part is `false`, then we can say nothing about the right part, because it can be either `false` or `true`. If the left part is `true`, then the right part must be `true`, otherwise this implication is invalid.

### Facts and queries

**Facts** are represented by uppercase letters. We will say that, by default, all facts are `false`. A fact can become true if it is in the set of **initial facts** (using the `=XXX` declaration) or by **deduction** from the rules.

The searched **queries** are declared using the `?XXX` notation.

## Implementing a resolver

### Forward and backward chaining

There are 2 ways to solve an expert system:

-   **Forward chaining:** We start from the facts and we deduct the result.
-   **Backward chaining:** We work backward, from the hypothesis to the facts.

This article will focus on the backward resolver only. The solver will use the same structure as the graph of the first image. Each element on the graph is called a `Node`. There is 2 sub-types of nodes:

-   the `AtomNode`, for example A, B or C.
-   the `ConnectorNode:` for `AND`, `XOR`, `OR` and `IMPLY`

Thatâ€™s why Python seemed to be the best fit, for its simplicity and object oriented properties.

## Data structure

### Node class

Nodes are the most important elements of the graph. They handle the logic and save their states. They are interconnected using `children` list. If we know the value of the child, we can deduct the value of the parent. For example, for the rule `A => B`, `A` is child of `=>` child of `B`. If `A` is true, then we deduct `B` is true.

All the subclass `AtomNode` and `ConnectorNode` inherit from this class.

### ConnectorNode class

## The resolver

### Step 1 â€” Create a list of unique atoms

The first step consist in parsing the input and create a unique list of `atoms`. It means that the **same letter in different rules** will always points to the same `AtomNode` instance.

### Step 2 â€” Create a RPN representation of all the rules

**_RPN â€” Reverse Polish Notation_**

The reverse polish notation gives a non ambiguous way to write **arithmetic formulas without the use of parentheses**.

This technique has many advantages:

-   It keeps the order of operands
-   You read it from left to right
-   Operands that precede the operator and the operand disappears to be replaced by the calculated value

### Step 3 â€” Create the relations between nodes

### Step 4â€” Resolve the queries
