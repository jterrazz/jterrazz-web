# Learn to Build a Simple, yet Powerful Web Server with Typescript and Koa

**Ready to take your web development skills to the next level and build your own custom web servers?** Look no further! In this tutorial, I‚Äôll walk you through the process of creating a simple HTTP request-handling project using the powerful combination of Typescript and Koa.

But first, **why choose Typescript?** It is the third most loved language by developers and has numerous benefits that make it worth considering. For one, it helps you write **safer** and more **reliable code** by enforcing strong type-checking. It also makes **collaborating with others more accessible** and faster, thanks to its straightforward and structured syntax. Many IDEs have excellent integration with Typescript, providing helpful suggestions and linting checks as you code.

As for **Koa**, it‚Äôs a lightweight framework that makes it **easy to understand the flow of your server and clearly organize your logic**. It also integrates seamlessly with the latest Javascript features, including native async support. And because it only does a little for you behind the scenes, it encourages you to learn and understand the core concepts of Node.js and backend development.

**So let‚Äôs get started building your first web server with Typescript and Koa! üéâ**

## Let‚Äôs begin!

‚Ä¶ with the basics. The following steps require nodejs and npm to be already installed.

You‚Äôll want to run the `npm` init command to get started on your new repository. It will prompt you to provide some information about your project, and then it will create a `package.json` file for you.

Once `npm` init is finished, you can install the packages you need for your project. In the example provided, you‚Äôre installing some packages twice: once for the package itself and once for the `@types/package` version.

The `@types/package` version installs the Typescript interfaces for the corresponding package. These interfaces provide **type definitions** for all the methods and variables in the package, which enables strong type-checking in your code.

So, to summarize, the `npm` init command sets up your project and creates a package.json file. Then you can install the necessary packages, including any `@types/package` versions, for added type-checking support.

### Using node with typescript

**Node.js does not natively support Typescript**, so we‚Äôll need to use a package called `ts-node` to convert our Typescript code to Javascript at runtime. To test this out, let‚Äôs create a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù file called `server.ts`.

If you try running the file with `node server.ts`, you may encounter an error. This is because we need to set up a script in our `package.json` file to use the `ts-node` package. You‚Äôll need to have installed the `ts-node` package to do this.

Once you‚Äôve set up the script, you can run your Typescript code using `npm start`. If everything is set up correctly, you should see ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù message printed on the console üòÉ

Finally, it‚Äôs a good idea to create a `.gitignore` file to prevent any unwanted files from being committed to your repository. This will help keep your codebase clean from `node` temporary files.

## Handle the first request ‚Äî koa

Next, we‚Äôll introduce the **Koa framework**, which will help us **structure our request-handling logic**. Essentially, when a user makes an HTTP request to our server, Koa helps us process the request and generate a response.

For example, the following snippet of a `GET /` request returns the message `Hello World!` :

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*w5QkqTrWpGJWUiX4pAc6VA.png)

One thing to note is that **Koa only handles the basic request and response flow**. If you want to do anything more advanced, like handling request bodies or routing requests to different functions, you‚Äôll need to set it up yourself (in this case, we‚Äôre using the `koa-router` package to handle routing). Other frameworks, like Express, come with these features bundled in, but using **Koa gives you a chance to understand the core concepts of the web more deeply** üòâ

Another critical concept to understand is the `app.use()` method, which allows you to **chain custom methods for each route, or at higher levels**.

These methods are called ‚Äú**middlewares** ‚Äù, and they modify a ‚Äú**context** ‚Äù object that gets passed along until the final method, called the ‚Äú**controller** ‚Äù (in this case, the `helloWorldController` function from above).

![Medium-Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*fZgR6JB8Pa6hHtzewoF_rw.png)

When the **controller** function finishes executing, the HTTP response is sent back to the user.

In the example code snippet, we‚Äôre using Koa to handle a GET request to the home route (`/` ) and returning a simple ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù message. I hope this helps clarify how Koa works and how it fits into the overall request-response flow of a web server.
