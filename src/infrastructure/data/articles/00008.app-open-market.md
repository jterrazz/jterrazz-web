# Experience the Future of Shopping with Open.MTâ€™s Open-Source Technologies

**The online world has revolutionized the way we shop**, offering unparalleled **convenience** and**access to a vast array of products** at unbeatable prices. With just a few clicks, you can have whatever you need delivered straight to your doorstep. From clothing and groceries to home goods and more, the internet has made it easy to find and purchase just about anything. And with popular marketplaces like Amazon and [insert countryâ€™s largest website here], itâ€™s easier than ever to compare prices and make informed purchasing decisions.

**But have you ever stopped to think about the impact of these services?** Theyâ€™re replacing local stores and libraries, and weâ€™re losing personal interactions with the merchants in our own communities. This can lead to declining revenues for these businesses and a lack of motivation to innovate. **Weâ€™re moving away from a model of independent merchants and towards one of centralized providers**, where a few large companies have even more control, censorship power, and the ability to engage in unfair competition in their markets.

**Is this really the direction we want to go in?**

**But can we change this trend ? What if we could associate both the convenience of internet, and merchants from your community ?**

We think itâ€™s possible at open.mt ! And thatâ€™s what we will try ðŸŒ±

### Internet and the decentralisation of communication

The internet has completely transformed the way we communicate with each other. In the past, communication channels were **controlled by a select few, such as newspapers**, which were seen as reliable and trustworthy sources of information. However, the rise of the internet and social media has given to **individuals the power to create and share their own news and opinions**. Now, anyone can create their own blog, feed, or platform and have the same reach as a professional journalist. While some platforms may still be centralized, the internet has opened up new avenues for people to freely participate and share their thoughts and ideas with the world.

What if we applied the same idea to commerce ? What if you were the one participating in this online commercial world ?

## What are we building ?

Our platform aims to **empower merchants** by giving them the ability to **register their shop, list their products, and engage in economic activity**. We simply facilitate connections between customers and merchants â€” **weâ€™re not the ones selling anything**. Additionally, weâ€™re committed to using the latest technologies to ensure that our platform is **decentralized** and **merchants have a lot of control over their own operations**.

So letâ€™s talk about the 3 values we believe are needed to achieve this goal.

### Innovation from the edges

Our platform is open to anyone and everyone, regardless of their size or experience. This means that **big brands, craftspeople, and small business owners can all participate** and have access to the same community. By not creating our own shops, we can benefit from the diversity and creativity of our merchants, who bring their own unique passions and expertise to the platform.

Our role is simply to connect customers and merchants, much like how Airbnb connects travelers with hosts. We provide **trust** and a **sense of community**, so that customers can have confidence in their shopping experience on our open market platform. Our goal is to make you believe that open marketplaces can be more enjoyable and reliable as any other shopping experience.

### A social experience

At the heart of our mission is a desire to make the shopping experience **easy, personalized, and social**. We believe in the power of local communities and the value of human connections, which is why we prioritize these elements in everything we do. Our focus is on people, not just products, and we strive to create a platform that reflects this philosophy.

### Trust you with open technologies

Our role is simple â€” **to connect merchants with customers**. Using open protocols and blockchain networks, we can **streamline and automate many of the interactions that would normally be handled by intermediaries**. This means that everything from delivery and warranties to buyer/seller insurance can be handled through decentralized contracts.

By embracing open source and smart contracts, we create a platform that is **transparent and open to innovation**. This allows individuals and businesses to develop new and creative solutions, such as using code to replace traditional postal services. The possibilities are endless, and we welcome any open protocols that share our vision of decentralization and transparency.

In summary, the three key pillars of open.mt are:

-   Giving individuals and small businesses the ability to**compete with larger commerce giants**.
-   **Enhancing the social connection** between merchants and customers.
-   Using decentralized protocols to **open up the flow of intermediaries** and create a more **transparent** and **innovative** marketplace.
